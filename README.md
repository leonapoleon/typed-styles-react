# Typed styles?
Not really. I like flow, but I can't help you out with that in a minified project. So I did the next best thing - utilized Facebook's own propTypes.

## What's the purpose?
This module is a helper for CSS in JS inspired by Daniel Steigerwald's este.js starter kit. It was created for React, but aims to be unopinionated in regards of CSS processing.

**Full documentation comming soon, sorry. It's still a WIP alpha.**
